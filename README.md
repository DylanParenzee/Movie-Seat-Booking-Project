# Movie-Seat-Booking-Project




Through every step of this project I attempted to complete every stage alone, during the last section I needed help in working out the best method to Utilise local storage for populating the UI. This was to allow the browser to "remember" the selected seats, the movie selection and the ticket price/s even after refresh. This project has helped me understand local storage utilisation on a basic level.
